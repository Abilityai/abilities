# Trinity Onboarding

Onboard any Claude Code agent to the Trinity Deep Agent Orchestration Platform. This skill guides you through the complete setup process.

## Prerequisites: Getting a Trinity Instance

**You need access to a Trinity instance before proceeding.**

### Option 1: Self-Host (Open Source)

Trinity is open source. Deploy your own instance:

1. Visit the Trinity repository: **https://github.com/abilityai/trinity**
2. Follow the installation instructions in the README
3. Once deployed, you'll have your own Trinity URL and can generate API keys

### Option 2: Managed by Ability AI

If you want Ability AI to provision and manage a Trinity instance for you:

**Contact us at: trinity@ability.ai**

We'll set you up with:
- A managed Trinity instance
- Your instance URL
- API credentials

---

## What You'll Need

Once you have a Trinity instance, gather these before starting:

| Item | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Trinity URL** | Your Trinity instance URL | `https://trinity.example.com` |
| **API Key** | Your Trinity API key | `tr_abc123...` |

Get your API key from your Trinity dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.

---

## Understanding the Local-Remote Model

Trinity uses a **paired agent architecture** where the same agent runs both locally (on your machine) and remotely (on Trinity). This enables powerful workflows that combine the best of both worlds.

### The Pairing Concept

                    (chat, execute, monitor)
```

**Key insight:** Both agents share the same identity—same skills, same instructions, same capabilities. They're synchronized through Git.

### GitHub as State Management

Your agent's **identity** lives in Git:

| What's Stored | Purpose | Synced? |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Agent's core instructions | ✓ Yes |
| `.claude/skills/` | Agent capabilities | ✓ Yes |
| `template.yaml` | Agent metadata | ✓ Yes |
| `memory/` | Persistent state, schedules | ✓ Yes |
| `scripts/` | Automation code | ✓ Yes |
| `.env`, `.mcp.json` | Credentials | ✗ No (gitignored) |
| `content/`, `session-files/` | Runtime data | ✗ No (gitignored) |

When you modify skills locally and push to GitHub, the remote agent pulls those changes and immediately has the new capabilities.

### Local Orchestrator Pattern

Your local Claude Code session acts as an **orchestrator** that controls remote execution:

```
Local (Orchestrator)                    Remote (Worker)
┌─────────────────┐                    ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │                    │                 │
│  You: "Process  │───── trigger ─────▶│  Executes task  │
│   100 videos"   │                    │  autonomously   │
│                 │                    │                 │
│  Monitor...     │◀──── status ──────│  Working...     │
│                 │                    │                 │
│  "Check status" │───── query ───────▶│  "75% done"     │
│                 │                    │                 │
│  Continue work  │                    │  Continues...   │
│  locally...     │                    │                 │
│                 │◀─── completion ────│  Done!          │
└─────────────────┘                    └─────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Start long-running tasks on remote, continue other work locally
- Remote agent runs 24/7 even when your laptop is closed
- Local agent can orchestrate multiple remote agents
- Pay for remote compute only when needed

### Heartbeat Pattern

For long-running tasks, use the **heartbeat pattern**—your local agent periodically checks on and manages remote execution:

```
Local Session                           Remote Agent
     │                                       │
     │──── "Start batch job" ───────────────▶│
     │                                       │ Working...
     │         (sleep 20 min)                │
     │                                       │
     │──── "Status check" ──────────────────▶│
     │◀─── "50% complete" ──────────────────│
     │                                       │
     │         (sleep 20 min)                │
     │                                       │
     │──── "Status check" ──────────────────▶│
     │◀─── "Done! Results at..." ───────────│
     │                                       │
```

Use scheduled skills or CronCreate to automate this polling.

### Collaboration Modes

| Mode | Tool/Command | Use Case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Execute** | `mcp__trinity__chat_with_agent` | Run task on remote, get response |
| **Deploy-Run** | `/trinity:sync` then `chat_with_agent` | Sync changes first, then execute |
| **Async Task** | `chat_with_agent(..., async=true)` | Fire-and-forget, poll with `get_execution_result` |
| **Scheduled** | `mcp__trinity__create_schedule` | Cron-based autonomous execution |

### When to Use Local vs Remote

| Scenario | Use Local | Use Remote |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Quick edits and testing | ✓ | |
| Interactive development | ✓ | |
| File browsing and exploration | ✓ | |
| Long-running batch jobs | | ✓ |
| Scheduled daily tasks | | ✓ |
| Always-on availability | | ✓ |
| Processing while laptop closed | | ✓ |
| Orchestrating multiple agents | ✓ | |

---

## Platform Capabilities (Post-Onboarding)

Once deployed to Trinity, agents gain access to these platform features. These don't require configuration during onboarding but are important to understand for full platform utilization.

### Persistent Setup Script

Agents can persist system-level packages (apt-get, npm -g, pip) across container restarts by placing a script at `~/.trinity/setup.sh`. This file runs automatically on every container start.

```bash
# Example: ~/.trinity/setup.sh (on the remote agent)
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get install -y -qq ffmpeg imagemagick
npm install -g typescript ts-node
pip install --user opencv-python moviepy
```

**How to set up:** Install packages on the remote agent, then append each install command to `~/.trinity/setup.sh`. The `/home/developer/` volume persists across container recreations, so the script survives image updates.

**Best practices:** Keep the script idempotent, use `-y` flags, minimize `apt-get` calls (each adds startup time).

### Voice Chat

Agents can accept real-time voice conversations via the Gemini Live API. Users click a microphone button in the Chat tab to speak naturally with the agent.

**To enable:**
1. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in platform environment variables
2. Set `VOICE_ENABLED=true` in platform settings
3. Create a voice system prompt file on the agent: `/home/developer/voice-agent-system-prompt.md`
   - Keep it concise (< 500 tokens), personality-focused
   - Example: "You are a helpful assistant. Keep responses under 2 sentences. Use casual, friendly language."

Transcripts are automatically saved to the chat session history.

### Channel Adapters (Slack & Telegram)

Agents can receive and respond to messages from Slack channels and Telegram groups. Each agent gets its own dedicated channel with identity customization (name + avatar).

**Slack setup** (from Trinity Settings):
1. Configure Slack OAuth credentials (Client ID, Secret, Signing Secret)
2. Install to workspace via OAuth flow
3. Per-agent: Agent Detail > Sharing > "Create Slack Channel"

**Telegram setup** (via agent .env):
- Set `ANNOUNCE_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` (from BotFather)
- Set `ANNOUNCE_TELEGRAM_UPDATES_CHANNEL` (chat ID, negative for groups)

Messages from Slack/Telegram users go through the same execution pipeline as web chat, with automatic rate limiting and audit trails.

### Per-User Persistent Memory

Public-facing agents (shared via public link) automatically maintain per-user memory for email-verified visitors. Memory is scoped to `(agent_name, user_email)` and injected into every conversation.

**No configuration needed** — this is automatic when:
- The public link has "Require email verification" enabled
- Users verify their email before chatting

Memory is summarized every 5 messages using Claude Haiku and persists across sessions.

### Execution Query Tools

Three MCP tools enable programmatic monitoring and async result polling:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_recent_executions` | List recent executions with optional status filter |
| `get_execution_result` | Get full result of a specific execution (including transcript) |
| `get_agent_activity_summary` | High-level activity summary (by trigger type, agent) |

These are especially useful for orchestrator agents monitoring worker fleets, and for polling async task results that exceed the 60-second MCP timeout.

                                   Create Files ──────────────────────────┘
                                   (templates only)
```

**Two paths available:**
- **Deploy to Trinity**: Full setup with credentials, MCP connection, and remote deployment
- **Adapt only**: Create Trinity-compatible files without connecting to any Trinity instance

---

## STEP 1: Analyze Current State

Check what exists in this agent directory:

```bash
ls -la
ls .claude/ 2>/dev/null
ls .claude/skills/ 2>/dev/null
cat template.yaml 2>/dev/null
cat .env 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

Present findings:

```
## Current State

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md | [EXISTS/MISSING] |
| template.yaml | [EXISTS/MISSING] |
| .gitignore | [EXISTS/MISSING/INCOMPLETE] |
| .env | [EXISTS/MISSING] |
| .mcp.json | [EXISTS/MISSING] |
| Git repository | [YES/NO] |
```

---

## STEP 1b: Ask About Onboarding Goal

After analyzing the current state, use AskUserQuestion to determine what the user wants:

**Question:** "What would you like to do with this agent?"

**Header:** "Goal"

**Options:**

1. **Deploy to Trinity** (Recommended)
   - Description: "Make this agent Trinity-compatible AND deploy it to your Trinity instance for remote execution, scheduling, and orchestration"

2. **Adapt only (no deployment)**
   - Description: "Create Trinity-compatible files (template.yaml, .gitignore, etc.) without connecting to or deploying to a Trinity instance"

**Based on the answer:**

- **If "Deploy to Trinity"**: Continue with Steps 2-6 (full flow)
- **If "Adapt only"**: Skip to Step 3, but:
  - Skip creating `.env` with credentials (Step 3b)
  - Skip creating `.mcp.json` with credentials (Step 4a)
  - Skip Step 5 (Deploy) entirely
  - Show "Adaptation Complete" instead of "Onboarding Complete"

---

## STEP 2: Get Trinity Credentials

**SKIP THIS STEP if user chose "Adapt only".**

Resolve credentials in this priority order:

### 2a. Check environment variable

If `TRINITY_API_KEY` is set in the environment, use it. Also check for `TRINITY_URL` env var.

### 2b. Check Trinity CLI profile

If env vars are not set, check for the Trinity CLI config file:

```bash
cat ~/.trinity/config.json 2>/dev/null
```

If the file exists, parse it:
1. Read `current_profile` to find the active profile name
2. Look up that profile in the `profiles` object
3. Extract `instance_url` — use as Trinity URL
4. Extract `token` — use as Bearer auth token / API key
5. If `mcp_api_key` is present, save it for MCP configuration in Step 4

**Example `~/.trinity/config.json`:**
```json
{
  "current_profile": "production",
  "profiles": {
    "production": {
      "instance_url": "https://trinity.example.com",
      "token": "tr_abc123...",
      "mcp_api_key": "mcp_xyz789..."
    }
  }
}
```

If credentials were found from env var or CLI profile, inform the user:

```
## Credentials detected

Found Trinity credentials from [environment variable / CLI profile "profile-name"]:
- **Instance**: [instance_url]
- **Auth**: [token prefix]...

Using these for onboarding. If you'd like to use different credentials, provide them now.
```

### 2c. Prompt user interactively (fallback)

If neither env var nor CLI profile is available, ask the user:

```
## Trinity Instance Configuration

To connect this agent to Trinity, I need your instance details.

**Don't have a Trinity instance yet?**
- Self-host: https://github.com/abilityai/trinity
- Managed service: Contact trinity@ability.ai

Please provide:

1. **Trinity Instance URL**
   The full URL to your Trinity instance (e.g., https://trinity.example.com)

2. **Trinity API Key**
   Your API key from Trinity dashboard > Settings > API Keys
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do not proceed until credentials are resolved from one of the three sources.

---

## STEP 3: Create Required Files

### 3a. Create template.yaml (if missing)

Detect agent name from directory:
```bash
basename "$(pwd)"
```

Create `template.yaml`:
```yaml
name: [agent-name-lowercase]
display_name: [Agent Display Name]
description: |
  [Description - ask user or extract from CLAUDE.md]
avatar_prompt: [A vivid character description for generating the agent's avatar portrait - see below]
resources:
  cpu: "2"
  memory: "4g"
```

**avatar_prompt guidance:** This field is used by Trinity to generate a portrait avatar for the agent using AI image generation. Write a vivid, specific character description that captures the agent's personality and role. The prompt should describe a person or character as a portrait subject — appearance, attire, expression, setting, and lighting.

Examples:
- `A wise elder advisor in a tailored charcoal suit, silver-haired with knowing eyes, seated in a mahogany-paneled study surrounded by strategic frameworks and books, warm authoritative presence`
- `A sharp-eyed explorer with binoculars and a weathered field journal, wearing a safari vest over a crisp shirt, confident and alert expression, warm golden-hour lighting`
- `A thoughtful analyst surrounded by floating data visualizations and charts, wearing smart-casual attire with reading glasses, warm studio lighting, contemplative expression`

Ask the user to describe what character or persona fits their agent, or propose one based on the agent's purpose from CLAUDE.md.

### 3b. Create .env

**SKIP THIS STEP if user chose "Adapt only".**

Create `.env` with the user's credentials:
```
# Trinity Platform Connection
TRINITY_URL=[user-provided-url]
TRINITY_API_KEY=[user-provided-key]
```

### 3c. Create .env.example

Create `.env.example` (safe to commit):
```
# Trinity Platform Connection
# Get your API key from your Trinity dashboard > Settings > API Keys
TRINITY_URL=https://your-trinity-instance.example.com
TRINITY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 3d. Create/Update .gitignore

Ensure these exclusions exist:
```gitignore
# Credentials - never commit
.mcp.json
.env
*.pem
*.key

# Claude Code internals
.claude/projects/
.claude/statsig/
.claude/todos/
.claude/debug/

# Runtime
content/
session-files/
```

---

## STEP 4: Configure MCP Connection

**SKIP THIS ENTIRE STEP if user chose "Adapt only".**

### 4a. Create .mcp.json

Determine the MCP API key to use, in this priority order:
1. `TRINITY_API_KEY` environment variable (explicit override)
2. `mcp_api_key` from the active CLI profile (if found in Step 2b)
3. `token` from the active CLI profile (if `mcp_api_key` is not present)
4. User-provided API key (from Step 2c)

Create `.mcp.json` with the actual Trinity URL and resolved API key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trinity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "[TRINITY_URL]/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "[MCP_API_KEY]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `[TRINITY_URL]` with the instance URL and `[MCP_API_KEY]` with the resolved MCP key.

### 4b. Create .mcp.json.template

Create `.mcp.json.template` with placeholders (safe to commit):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trinity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "${TRINITY_URL}/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "${TRINITY_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4c. Verify MCP Connection

Tell the user:

```
## MCP Configuration Created

I've created .mcp.json with your Trinity credentials.

**To activate the connection, you need to restart Claude Code.**

Please:
1. Exit this Claude Code session
2. Start Claude Code again in this directory
3. Run `/trinity:onboard` again to continue

The Trinity MCP tools will then be available.
```

**If Trinity MCP tools are already available** (check if `mcp__trinity__list_agents` works), skip to Step 5.

---

## STEP 5: Deploy to Trinity

**SKIP THIS ENTIRE STEP if user chose "Adapt only" — go directly to Step 6.**

### 5a. Initialize Git (if needed)

```bash
if [ ! -d .git ]; then
  git init
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Initial commit for Trinity onboarding"
fi
```

### 5b. Check for existing tracking file

Check if `.trinity-remote.yaml` exists:

```bash
cat .trinity-remote.yaml 2>/dev/null
```

If it exists:
- Read the `agent` name and `instance` URL from it
- If the `instance` differs from the current Trinity URL, warn the user:
  ```
  ⚠ The tracking file (.trinity-remote.yaml) points to a different instance:
    Tracking file: [instance from file]
    Current credentials: [current instance URL]
  
  Do you want to deploy to the current instance (will update tracking file)?
  ```
- Use the `agent` name from the tracking file for redeployment unless the user overrides

### 5c. Deploy Agent

Deploy using the MCP tool:

```
mcp__trinity__deploy_local_agent(
  archive: [base64-encoded tar.gz of agent directory],
  name: [agent-name from template.yaml]
)
```

To create the archive:
```bash
tar -czf /tmp/agent.tar.gz --exclude='.git' --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='__pycache__' --exclude='.venv' --exclude='.env' -C "$(pwd)" .
base64 -i /tmp/agent.tar.gz
```

After deploy succeeds, write the tracking file:

```yaml
# Auto-generated by trinity deploy — do not edit
instance: [TRINITY_URL]
agent: [agent-name]
profile: [CLI profile name if used, or "default"]
deployed_at: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
```

Save this as `.trinity-remote.yaml` in the agent directory.

### 5d. Verify Deployment

```
mcp__trinity__get_agent(name: "[agent-name]")
```

Confirm the agent is running.

---

## STEP 6: Completion

Only show this when the agent is successfully deployed:

```
## Trinity Onboarding Complete!

Your agent is now live on Trinity.

### Summary
- **Agent**: [agent-name]
- **Trinity URL**: [trinity-url]
- **Status**: Running

### Files Created
- [x] template.yaml
- [x] .env (with your credentials)
- [x] .env.example (template)
- [x] .gitignore
- [x] .mcp.json (with your credentials)
- [x] .mcp.json.template (template)
- [x] .trinity-remote.yaml (deployment tracking)

### Next Steps

1. **Interact with your remote agent:**
   Use `mcp__trinity__chat_with_agent` with your agent name and message.

2. **Sync local changes to remote:**
   ```
   /trinity:sync
   ```

3. **Set up scheduled tasks:**
   Use `mcp__trinity__create_schedule` with agent name, skill, and cron expression.

### Files Created
- [x] template.yaml (agent metadata)
- [x] .env.example (credential template)
- [x] .gitignore (with Trinity patterns)
- [x] .mcp.json.template (MCP config template)

### What's NOT configured (by your choice)
- [ ] .env (no credentials stored)
- [ ] .mcp.json (no MCP connection)
- [ ] Remote deployment (agent not on Trinity)

### When You're Ready to Deploy

Run `/trinity:onboard` again and choose "Deploy to Trinity" to:
1. Connect to your Trinity instance
2. Configure MCP tools
3. Deploy this agent to the platform

### Files Ready for Git

You can now commit these Trinity-compatible files:
```bash
git add template.yaml .env.example .gitignore .mcp.json.template
git commit -m "Add Trinity compatibility files"
```
```

## Mode: Analyze Only

If user runs `/trinity:onboard analyze`:

Only perform Steps 1-2 (check state and gather info), then present a report without making any changes.

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| No CLAUDE.md | Create minimal CLAUDE.md first |
| MCP tools not available | Restart Claude Code after creating .mcp.json |
| Deployment failed | Check Trinity URL and API key are correct |
| Agent already exists | Will update existing agent |
| Git clone/pull fails on remote | Configure GitHub PAT in Trinity (see below) |

## Troubleshooting: GitHub PAT for Private Repos

If Trinity fails to clone or pull from your GitHub repository after deployment, the most common cause is a missing or incorrectly configured GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

### When is a PAT Required?

- **Private repositories** — Always required
- **Public repositories** — Not required, but recommended to avoid rate limits

### Creating a Fine-Grained PAT

1. Go to **GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens**
2. Click **Generate new token**
3. Configure the token:
   - **Token name**: `Trinity` (or similar)
   - **Expiration**: Choose based on your security policy
   - **Repository access**: Select "Only select repositories" and choose the repos Trinity needs
   - **Permissions**: Under "Repository permissions", set **Contents** to **Read-only**
4. Click **Generate token** and copy the token (starts with `github_pat_`)

### Configuring the PAT in Trinity

**Option 1: Via Trinity Settings UI (Recommended)**

1. Log in to your Trinity dashboard
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Find the **GitHub PAT** field
4. Paste your token and save

**Option 2: Via Environment Variable**

Add to your Trinity `.env` file:
```bash
GITHUB_PAT=github_pat_your_token_here
```

Then restart Trinity services.

### Verifying the PAT Works

After configuring, test by:
1. Creating a new agent from your GitHub template, or
2. Triggering a git sync on an existing agent

If the pull still fails, verify:
- The PAT has not expired
- The PAT has access to the specific repository
- The PAT has the **Contents: Read** permission

| `/trinity:connect` | First-time authentication and MCP setup |
| `/trinity:sync` | Git-based synchronization with remote |

For remote operations, schedules, and credentials, use MCP tools directly:
- `mcp__trinity__chat_with_agent` — Execute tasks on remote agent
- `mcp__trinity__list_schedules` / `create_schedule` — Manage scheduled tasks
- `mcp__trinity__list_agents` — View deployed agents
